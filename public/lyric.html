                    I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
                    Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface <br>
                    I don't know what you're expecting of me <br>
                    Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes <br>
    
                    <br>
                    <mark id='mark-1' class="lyric__marked">
                         Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow 
                    </mark>
                    <br>

                    Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
                    Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow <br>
    
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                    Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
                    I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
                    Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
    
                    <br>
                    Can't you see that you're smothering me? 
                    <br>
                    Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control <br>
                    'Cause everything that you thought I would be <br>
                    Has fallen apart, right in front of you <br>
    
                    <br>
                    Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow <br>
                    Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
                    Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow <br>
                    And every second I waste is more than I can take <br>
    
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                    Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
                    I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
                    Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
    
                    <br>
                    And I know I may end up failing, too <br>
                    But I know you were just like me <br>
                    With someone disappointed in you <br>
    
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                    Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
                    I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
                    Is be more like me and be less like you <br>
    
                    <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                    I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
                    I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                    I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
